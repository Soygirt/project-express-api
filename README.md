# Project Express API

Replace this readme with your own information about your project.

Start by briefly describing the assignment in a sentence or two. Keep it short and to the point.

## The problem

The problem was to build our first API.
To solve this problem I've used Technigos info videos, a code along provided by Technigo, and ChatGPT to help me find bugs.
I didn't do much planning, I started off by watching the provided videos, and then I followed the code along for a bit.
If I had more time, I'd shorten the ratings so you could rate them with one number, like rate/3. Now you have to be precise, like rate/3.47.

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
